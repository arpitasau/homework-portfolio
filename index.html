          <p>Hi there, this is Arpita K Sau, resident of one of the beautiful suburbs of Chicagoland, Illinois. Friends, colleagues and family knows me as a well-read, hardworking, and  composed person. I am a mom to my 8 years old daughter and a working woman. As a person I prefer to perform in all shoes with complete dedication, passion and try to strike a balance between by roles as a parent and a professional.</p>
          <p>I did my Masters in Science, specializing in Botany and then started off as a teacher teaching Chemistry and Biology in high school in India. It has always been my dream or a wish to work in the software industry, so I enrolled myself in a professional course to become a Software Quality and Business Analyst. After passing the course with flying colors I landed a job as a Software Quality Analyst at entry level in one of the renowned software companies in India.</p>
          <p>I got married and relocated to the US with my husband. In the US I got certifications to refine my skills to perform better as a Quality Analyst and worked with various US clients as Quality Analyst. Currently, I am working as a Senior Quality Engineer with W.W. Grainger, Chicago, IL.</p>
          <p>I have seven years of experience in Software Quality Assurance (Manual and Automation) with extensive knowledge in testing both web based and client server applications. I am well versed
          with various SDLC methodologies like Agile & Waterfall and supporting the testing efforts during the various phases of the project. My expertise is testing SOAP and REST Web Services using SoapUI.</p>
          <p>Experienced in data driven testing, cross browser testing and parallel test execution using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG and Selenium Grid.</p>
          <p>Now I have taken up a new challenge, yeah… to become a full-stack software developer and would love to see myself as software developer in coming years!!!</p>
          <p>If I am not working, my entire time goes in taking care of my family, trying out new recipes, making art and crafts with my daughter and reading…..</p>
          <p>This is me in nutshell ……….  </p>
          <p>Hit me in any of the below mode of communications if you want to be part of my professional network.</p>
